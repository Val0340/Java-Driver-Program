This is a program for the summation of a non-negative integer. Threads are the fundamental model of program executon in a java program. There are two techniques for creating threads in a Java program.
One approach is to create a new class that is derived from the Thread class and to override its run() method. An alternative -- and more commonly used -- technique is to define a class that implements
the Runnable interface , with "void run()".
